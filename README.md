# ignorenet
ignorenet aims to integrate existing linked open biomedical resources and software/tools with publicly available high-throughput data repositories to identify and annotate the function of uncharacterized disease-associated genes for a specific disease. ignorenet is associated with the 2017 [BioHackathon](http://2017.biohackathon.org/). Details and code will be post September 2017. In the meantime, see associated [GitPage](https://callahantiff.github.io/ignorenet/) for project details.
